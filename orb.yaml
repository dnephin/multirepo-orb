  Multirepo and monorepo support for CircleCI.

commands:
  run-job-for-paths:
    description: |
      Continue running the job if any file in paths has been modified since
      the last commit shared with the upstream git branch (default: origin/master).

      This command must be run after `checkout`.
  
      This command allows you to skip all of the subsequent steps in a job so that any
      repository with multiple workflows, or multiple flows within a single
      workflow, will only run CI jobs relevant to the files that changed.
  
      If you have a multipurpose git repository with independent directory trees
      this command allows you to run the tests for only the services which have been
      modified relative to the upstream branch.
  
    parameters:
      paths:
